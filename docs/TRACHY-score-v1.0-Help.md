# About the TRACHY Score Calculator

The **TRACHY Score** is a clinically oriented decision-support tool designed to guide post-operative airway management for patients with head and neck cancer. Specifically, it assists surgical teams in determining whether a patient undergoing resection with primary flap reconstruction can be safely managed with **endotracheal intubation alone** or if an **elective tracheostomy** is indicated.

## The TRACHY Model

The score is calculated based on six pre-operative variables represented by the acronym **TRACHY**:

| Variable | Description | Scoring |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T** | Tumour T-stage (TNM) | T1–T2: 0 pts |
| **R** | Type of Reconstruction | Fasciocutaneous: 0 pts |
| **A** | Anatomy of Tumour (Site) | Lateral or central: 0 pts |
| **C** | Coexisting Conditions (ASA) | ASA I–II: 0 pts |
| **H** | History of Previous Treatment | None: 0 pts |
| **Y** | Laterality (Neck Dissection) | Unilateral/None: 0 pts |

## Clinical Interpretation

Based on the original study by Mohamedbhai et al., the threshold for intervention is **4 points**:

* **Score < 4:** The patient can likely be managed safely with endotracheal tube (ETT) alone.
* **Score ≥ 4:** Elective tracheostomy is indicated for safe airway management.

### Statistical Performance

At the threshold of 4 or more, the model demonstrated:

* **Sensitivity:** 91.4%
* **Specificity:** 90.8%
* **Positive Predictive Value (PPV):** 90.9%
* **Negative Predictive Value (NPV):** 88.2%
