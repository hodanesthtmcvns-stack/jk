# AIR-v2.0: About & Help Guide

**AIR-v2.0 (Anesthesia Intraoperative Record)** is a specialized digital companion designed for anesthesia residents. It serves a dual purpose: a structured documentation tool and an educational guide for navigating clinical pathways and safety protocols.

## About the Project

In a high-stakes clinical environment, **AIR-v2.0** acts as a framework for residents to ensure safety and precision. By integrating clinical pathways and safety checklists directly into the documentation workflow, the app helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and bedside practice.

### Key Educational & Clinical Features

* **Clinical Pathways**: Guided sections for General Anesthesia (GA), Spinal, Epidural, and Peripheral Nerve Blocks, helping residents follow standardized anesthetic management.
* **Safety Checklists**: Integrated checkpoints (such as airway assessment, NPO status, and pre-medication verification) to instill a "safety-first" mindset.
* **Structured Documentation**: A comprehensive flow from pre-anesthetic evaluation to post-operative recovery orders.
* **Vitals Integration**: Tools to record and monitor patient vitals, including a CSV import feature to map data from patient monitors.

## Help & User Guide

### 1. Navigating the Clinical Workflow

The app is organized chronologically to mirror an actual anesthesia case:

* **Pre-Op Assessment**: Start here to verify patient history, labs, and NPO status. This app **must be used with the output of the PAC app** - in particular - the Plan Based Airway Assessment.
* **Clinical Pathways**: Choose your technique (General, Regional, or Nerve Block). The app will display fields specific to that pathway (e.g., needle gauge for Spinal or airway device for GA).
* **Safety Check**: Before induction, use the integrated fields to verify airway management plans and induction drug dosages.
* **Intra-Op Vitals**: Enter vitals manually or use the **Import CSV** function to bring in data from a clinical monitor.

### 2. Interface Controls

* **View Modes**: Use the **Mobile View** toggle at the top of the screen if you are using a tablet or phone at the head of the bed.
* **Dark Mode**: Switch to Dark Mode for better visibility in dimmed operating rooms.
* **Section Management**: Use **Expand All** to see the full clinical picture or **Collapse All** to focus on one section at a time.

### 3. Saving and Exporting

* **Save Record**: Click this to store your progress in your browser's local memory. *Note: Data is stored locally and will be lost if you clear your browser cache.*
* **PDF Export**: Once the case is complete, generate a professional PDF. This is ideal for your educational logbook or for printing and signing for the physical medical record.
* **XML Export**: Use this for data backup or for research/audit purposes.

## Privacy & Local Security

* **100% Client-Side**: All data entry and PDF generation happen locally in your browser.
* **No Data Tracking**: No patient information is ever transmitted to a server or stored in the cloud.
* **User Responsibility**: As this is a local tool, residents are responsible for ensuring that any exported files are handled in compliance with their hospital's patient privacy (HIPAA/GDPR) policies.

---

## Technical Requirements

* **Platform**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
* **Offline Use**: Once the `.html` file is saved to your device, it can be used without an active internet connection, making it reliable in all hospital areas.
